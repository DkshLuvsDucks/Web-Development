node (opens a cmdlet like console to run js commands)

.exit (to close, or press ctrl+c)
.save

Use cmd "node <script name>" to execute them

process: This object provides info about, and control over the current node.js process
process.argv: returns an array containing the cmd line arguments passed when the node.js process was launched

module.exports : a special object
require() : used to import external modules that exist in seperate file

npm = Node Package Manager

npm install <pkg name> (local installation, only works in the folder it was installed in)
npm i <pkg name> (this also works, i is an alias for install)

npm install -g <pkg name> (global installation)
u need to give permission to node_modules for this: sudo chown $USER /usr/local/lib/node_modules
after this run: npm link <pkg name>

node modules folder contains every installed dependency for the project
package-lock.json stores the exact version of every installed dependency, it includes sub dependency and their versions as well
package.json file contains descriptive and functional metadata about a project, such as name, version, dependencies

package.json is very important, if u deleted node_modules folder by mistake u can just run "npm install" it will install all dependencies stated in package.json and will help in retrieving the node_modules folder again

npm init
