        <p>
            Jeff the Land Shark debuted officially in West Coast Avengers #7 (2019), created by Kelly Thompson and Daniele di Nicuolo. Landsharks first appeared in issue #1 (2018), and Jeff was inspired by one of the designs along with Thompson's cats. Originally part of a running gag where Gwen Poole adopted and named various animals "Jeff," the character quickly gained popularity and became a recurring part of the series. Jeff returned in titles like Gwenpool Strikes Back, Deadpool (vol. 8), and Marvel #1000.
            <br><br>
            Jeff’s popularity grew thanks to fan art by Gurihiru, which led to more appearances and even in-universe merchandise. He became the star of It's Jeff!, a silent comedy digital comic launched in 2021 on Marvel Unlimited, written by Thompson and drawn by Gurihiru. The series has had four seasons and several print collections, including It's Jeff! #1 and The Jeff-Verse #1. Jeff also appeared in Marvel Meow, Infinity Paws, Extreme Venomverse, and Venom War: It's Jeff!.
            <br><br>
            Jeff continued to appear in digital series like Jeff Week and Marvel Rivals Infinity Comic (2024), and guest-starred in Gwenpool (2025) with Kate Bishop. He now headlines his own limited print series, Jeff the Land Shark (2025), and is set to appear with Krypto in Deadpool/Batman #1, a Marvel/DC crossover.

        <h2>Fictional Character Biography</h2>
        <p>
            The land sharks were created by MODOK Superior, and after his defeat by the West Coast Avengers, Gwen Poole adopted a baby land shark and named him Jeff—after a kitten she previously had to give up. Gwen, who has a shark-themed aesthetic, including a shark backpack and phone case, added Jeff to the West Coast Avengers. Later, fearing her own declining presence in comics would affect Jeff’s future, she temporarily entrusted him to Deadpool, whose title was then canceled, and briefly to Elsa Bloodstone.
            <br><br>
            In It's Jeff! (2021), Jeff is shown living again with Gwen and Kate Bishop. The series humorously depicts him sledding with Captain America's shield, eating the Infinity Gauntlet, and stealing Thanksgiving dinner. Gwen returns in Season 2 to continue co-parenting Jeff with Kate. During the Venom War storyline, Jeff bonds with a Symbiote, helps fight off a Zombiote invasion alongside Kate, Gwen, America Chavez, and Fuse, and later celebrates their victory with churros.
